This repository contains Python scripts designed to automate the preparation of GFS-report. The process is divided into multiple steps, because after each step some VLOOKUP columns, conditional criteria, and pivot tables are added manually.

The original goal was full automation, but some Excel operations—like complex VLOOKUPs, conditional columns, and pivots—were taking too much time or there were errors. Therefore, I opted for a semi-automated approach. Now, around 60% of the work is automated, including data cleaning, formatting, filtering, and merging, while only the more complex operations are done manually.
